pixel-canvas
============

This tool aims to allow for the quick creation of pixel based art in the browser using jQuery and PHP's GD image library.

It supports color-history, so you can design a pallette and then use it without having to search for the values again in the main list.

Also, you can click-and-drag to quickly fill in larger spaces, fill the canvas with a single color for a background, or clear the canvas back to white.

After saving, the image is rendered and presented where it can be downloaded. Images are stored locally for a time, but aren't listed anywhere in the application, so if you like it, save it!
